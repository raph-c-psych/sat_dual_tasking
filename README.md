#  Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off in Dual Tasking

**Purpose:** This repository contains the scripts of a research intership seminar under Dr. Aleks Pieczykolan in the summer semester of 2025


## 1. Simulation of Data from related Study (01_Lehle_et_al_2009)

**Related Study**:
Lehle, C., Steinhauser, M., & Hübner, R. (2009). Serial or parallel processing in dual tasks: What is more effortful? *Psychophysiology*, 46(3), 502–509. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2009.00806.x

**Files**: 

- **simulating_Lehle_et_al_2009.R:** contains the code for simulating the data and generating related plots
- **plots \[folder\]:** contains plots visualizing Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off and Balanced Integration Score for the study of Lehle et al., 2009

## 2. Processing Data from current sutdy (02_processing_data)

**Files:**

- **raph_processing.R:** File for processing the data, based upon script by Dr. Pieczykolan
- (data sets are stored in external folder for privacy reasons)



## 3. Data Analysis of own Research Questions (03_data_analysis)

**Files:**

- **data_analysis.R:** file for analysing data (contains exclusion of outliers, generating plots, inferential testing and a-posteriori power analysis)
- **overview_plot.jpg:** shows the results of reaction time, errror rate, Balanced Integration Score and Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off between independent variables of strategy & instruction
